# Projects! 

## Here are some of my projects that I have been working on:
### Peppa Pig Inspired Video Game
    This project was submitted in May of 2021. Our task was to show off
     object oriented programming skills we had learned over the course of the 
     semester. This game was coded using Java and was one of the first time working
     with other students on a game.

### Legacy Code Project
     This project was submitted in December of 2021. During our software
     development class, we were assigned groups of 5 to work on legacy code.
     For the entire semester, my team and I followed a scrum sprint cycle. 
     The game was inspired by Mario Bros and was written in Java.

### Android Fragment Project
     This project was submitted in April of 2022. Throughout the semester in our 
     Android development class, my team and I have been working on different challenges.
     This challenge included taking our previous app and changing the app so it used fragments.
     Our app using an API for root notes and chords. Our app prompts the user to choose a root note
     and takes the user to another screen that displays a list of all possible chords. The project was coded
     in Java and used Android Studios.
