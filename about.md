##  Why I decided coding: 

    I first started coding in Scratch when I was 13. My middle school had a stem program
    so I joined with a few friends. I had a fun time building games but I wanted to learn
    more languages that were not block based. So, when I entered high school I continued 
    taking coding classes and ultimately decided that this was what I wanted a career in.

##  My interests:

    App and web development have been a passion of mine forever. I am currently taking an
    Android development class here at QU! During my time in high school I also learned an 
    introduction to HTML. I also am interested in education and cyber-security. 

## Outside the classroom:

    While on campus I am a facilitator for Girls Who Code. Girls Who Code is an organization
    that promotes girl empowerment and teaches girls ages 10-17 how to code! As a facilitator 
    I worked with girls every Tuesday throughout the semester on their coding projects along with 
    a group of other facilitators. The girls used Scratch, JavaScript and Python.
    I also am a part of the Student Programming Board at QU as a general member. There 
    I help with running campus events for the QU community.
