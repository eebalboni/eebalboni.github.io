# About Me

###  Hello! My name is Emily Balboni and I am a sophmore Software Engineering Major
###  with a math minor at Quinnipiac University.  
###  I graduated from Marshfield High School in May of 2020.

##  Why I decided coding: 

###  I first started coding in Scratch when I was 13. My middle school had a stem program
    so I joined with a few friends. I had a fun time building games but I wanted to learn
    more languages that were not block based. So, when I entered high school I continued 
    taking coding classes and ultimately decided that this was what I wanted a career in.

##  My interests:

###  App and web development have been a passion of mine forever. I am currently taking an
    Android development class here at QU! During my time in high school I also learned an 
    introduction to HTML. I also am interested in education and cyber-security. 

## Outside the classroom:

###  While on campus I am a facilitator for Girls Who Code. Girls Who Code is an organization 
###  that promotes girl empowerment and teaches girls ages 10-17 how to code! As a facilitator 
###  I worked with girls every Tuesday throughout the semester on their coding projects along with 
###  a group of other facilitators. The girls used Scratch, JavaScript and Python.
###  I also am a part of the Student Programming Board at QU as a general member. There 
###  I help with running campus events for the QU community.
